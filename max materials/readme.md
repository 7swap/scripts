Description: This script will add a normal map to an existing 3DS Max Standard material

Usage: Your normal maps should be named consistently. Mine have a "\_nrm" appended to each file. If you use a different naming convention then change "\_nrm" to yours and make sure that the normal maps are in the same folder as the diffuse map.
